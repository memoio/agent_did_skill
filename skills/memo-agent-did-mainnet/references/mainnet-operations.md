# MEMO Mainnet operations

## Environment

- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_INSTALLATION_ID`: stable Runtime installation identifier. Required when one host runs multiple Agents.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_HOME`: mainnet-only state root. Never reuse the old Skill root.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_ENVIRONMENT`: `local`, `preprod`, or `production`.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_API_URL`: loopback HTTP in `local`; HTTPS otherwise.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_API_ORIGINS`: comma-separated exact HTTPS origins allowed in preprod/production.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_KEY_PROVIDER`: `auto`, `os-keyring`, or `env-master-key`.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_MASTER_KEY`: administrator-supplied wrapping input for `env-master-key`; at least 32 characters. Identity private keys remain encrypted in their key file. Do not generate this input automatically or put it in chat, argv, logs or a checked-in file. The provider is not mechanically restricted to test registration; long-lived use requires managed persistence, protection and recovery.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_ALLOW_R2=1`: explicit trusted grant for reversible/normal chain actions.
- `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_ALLOW_R4_TEST=1`: disposable local chain-985 test grant only. It is ignored outside `local` loopback mode.

The chain ID is fixed at `985`. Supplying any other `MEMO_AGENT_MAINNET_CHAIN_ID` fails closed.

## Startup and identity

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet doctor --json
```

Only after identity creation was requested and the checks pass:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity ensure --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity status --json
```

Runtime adapters call `bootstrapMemoAgentMainnetRuntime`, which performs exactly `doctor → ensure → status`. These commands do not contact the API or chain. `identity init` is a deprecated alias. A status response exposes public material only; there is intentionally no private-key export command.

Installation requests stop after runtime setup and `doctor`; the runtime bootstrap helper also creates identity and is only appropriate when creation was requested. Default to the user's computer or an explicitly selected long-lived host. A cloud session uses that remote host's storage, not the user's computer's keyring. Do not infer execution location or storage durability from the model, client, directory or container markers.

Runtime setup retains `ready` but adds `readyScope: "runtime-dependencies"` on success and failure. Installer success adds `runtimeDependenciesReady: true` and `identityStorageChecked: false`. Neither checks identity storage or creates identity. Doctor retains the CLI schema, exit status and existing `ready` calculation, and adds `identityStorageReady`, `blockingChecks`, `platformConnectivityChecked: false` and `guidance`. R2/R4 grants and environment master-key presence are informational checks, not independent offline-creation requirements. A known provider may still lack accessible wrapping material; `secureStorageReady` determines storage readiness.

Doctor's URL-policy check does not test API connectivity. Offline creation does not require a reachable API or chain grants, but remains bound to the configured deployment environment and URL policy: an identity created under default `local` must not be reused for preprod/production. Configure the intended environment and allowed HTTPS origin before creating an identity for those environments; API reachability is only needed for network operations. Doctor may initialize installation metadata and SQLite state, but does not create identity keys, verify long-term persistence or configure a secret store.

Register an existing local identity explicitly:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity register --profile profile.json --json
```

The Skill opens a short Agent session by signing a fixed-format EIP-191 challenge, validates `/api/v1/chain/config`, rebuilds the `RegisterAgent` EIP-712 digest locally, signs it, submits it with the digest as the idempotency key, and waits for finality. A failed registration retains the same DID and Identity Key.

Read and lifecycle commands:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity resolve did:memo:agent:985:0x... --verify --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity update-profile --profile profile.json --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity update-document --document document.json --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity suspend --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity resume --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity revoke --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet operation reconcile op_... --json
```

`revoke` is permanent. A canonical reorg does not create a new action: the worker replays the original signed action only while its Registry nonce remains unconsumed and its deadline remains valid.

## Instances and authentication

The default Instance Key is created only after registration reaches `CONFIRMED`. Identity and Instance keys use different handles.

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet instance create --name worker-01 --ttl 24h --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet instance list --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet instance revoke inst_... --reason rotated --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet identity self-test --json
```

Challenge signing accepts only the declared `AuthChallenge` schema, a short time window, and an unused issuer/nonce pair.

## Pairing and management

Pairing v2 supports two directions. A Platform Invitation is downloaded by the wallet user and accepted by the Agent:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet pair invitation accept \
  --invitation-file /path/to/platform-invitation.memo-pair.json \
  --profile /path/to/profile.json \
  --json
```

The Skill verifies the file, claims it through an Agent session, registers the existing local DID if needed, waits for Registry finality, and then completes the off-chain binding. Alternatively, the Agent creates an Offer for wallet import:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet pair offer create \
  --offer-file /path/to/agent-offer.memo-pair.json \
  --max-scopes profile.update,instance.issue \
  --max-term 30d \
  --ttl 15m \
  --profile /path/to/profile.json \
  --json
```

`--profile` is optional: an explicit file wins, then a persisted snapshot, then a minimal “Unnamed Agent” profile. Offer output uses exclusive creation and mode `0600`; Invitation input must be a current-user-owned regular file, never a symlink. Both files contain a secret handle. Never print, paste, log, or commit their contents. The JSON envelope returns only exchange ID, state, DID, operation/finality fields, and the output path.

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet pair status poff_... --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet pair resume pinv_... --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet pair cancel poff_... --json
```

The removed `pair create` command fails with `PAIRING_V1_REMOVED`. Pairing itself is off-chain and creates a management draft; it does not grant management authority.

The Console wallet creates and signs a management intent. The Agent polls without disclosing its Identity Key:

```sh
bin/memo-agent-mainnet agent-request next --wait-seconds 20 --json
bin/memo-agent-mainnet agent-request approve --id req_... --json
# or
bin/memo-agent-mainnet agent-request reject --id req_... --reason declined --json
```

Approval revalidates the chain, Management Registry, typed fields, target Agent, digest, deadline, and manager proofs before the local Identity Key signs. Activation/renewal requires Agent + Manager signatures; transfer requires Agent + old Manager + new Manager; ending requires either Agent or current Manager.

## Security and recovery

- The OS keyring service is `com.memo.agent-did.mainnet`; its account includes installation ID and key version.
- `keys.enc.json` contains only AES-256-GCM ciphertext and is mode `0600`.
- A missing keyring secret, public-key mismatch, Registry mismatch, API-origin mismatch, or deployment-environment mismatch is a quarantine condition. Never generate a replacement key.
- Preprod and production use different Identity Keys and state roots. There is no silent migration from the old Skill or local chain.
- `identity key-migrate --to os-keyring --json` migrates only within this mainnet installation and verifies that the DID and public key are unchanged.
- Session bearer tokens are kept in process memory and platform storage contains only token hashes.
- Management does not grant Vault, Memory, Data, MCP, or Gateway access.
